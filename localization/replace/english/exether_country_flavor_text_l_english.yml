  DUM_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Empire of Dumonia is a land of ancient traditions and fading glory, once the center of human power before the rise of magic brought it crashing down. The Nightfall led to the collapse of most of the empire, and today only the heartlands on Noricum remain under imperial control. Dumonia is a shadow of its former self and lags behind the technological advancements that have swept other nations. \n\nBut the young emperor of the Romhaar family, eager to restore the empire's former glory, has sought to chart a new path for Dumonia. He has turned his sights towards the southeastern continent of Locari, a vast and untamed wilderness filled with new wonders and untold riches waiting to be claimed. \n\nWith his support, a new wave of Dumonian colonizers has set out to tame the wilds of Locari under the leadership of the South Seas Company, building new settlements and bringing with them the promise of progress and prosperity. But their presence has not gone unopposed, and the colonizers must constantly struggle against the fierce resistance of the indigenous peoples who call Locari home. \n\nMeanwhile, a new force has arisen in the empire: the fanatical Order of the Sun. This religious organization worships the god of the sun and has gained a powerful following among the Dumonian people. The Order's zealotry has fueled a renewed sense of pride and purpose in the empire, but also a dangerous streak of fanaticism and intolerance. \n\nAs the empire struggles to find its place in a changing world, tensions simmer and threats loom on all sides. But one thing is clear: the fate of Dumonia hangs in the balance, and only bold and visionary leadership will be able to guide it through the challenges ahead."

This land has incurred the punishment of the nightbane, and Jurian answers the call.

This expedition will prove his faith and spread the truth of Kamiros to the ignorant. May the night horrors fear, for the sunkissed have arrived."
  YAN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Yanger Nomads are a people hailing from the the vast steppes of the western reaches of Noricum. Historically, these lands were a former imperial province of Dumonia, the land ripe for wealthy Dumonian ranchers.  However, it was not the wealthy Dumonian landowner who would come to rule the steppe; but the horselords of the Yanger and their riders.  Now, Dumonia has retreated to its' heartland, and these steppes lay in control of men hardened by war. With much talk of magic and the return of the gods, people look for an answer. In the eternal skies of the steppes exists a chaotic storm, serving as a prophecy for the many religious of forthcoming change. The steppe-riders lie prepared to weather the storm once more."
  AUM_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Order of the Sun is a dominion within the Dumonian Empire. It is a small, although powerful, semi-independent theocratic state that serves as the centre of the faith for the Cult of the Sun. The state is said to be guided directly by Holy Kamiros, Lord of Light, with the high priest merely acting as their interpreter. The Bright Judge works to uphold this righteous land as a haven for all believers by driving away darkness and spreading his divine nature through his holy word. This sacred land is a beacon for all who seek Kamiros and his teachings."

Will Ceraun continue its existince as a buffer state for foreign powers or can a new Cerunite state emerge beneath the shadow of the Empire?"
  BDB_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Buramog Wars, a series of conflicts opposing Ceraun to the Buramog Orcish clans, have left the Orcish lands blighted as the Cerunite's Wyldfire Tincture, a powerful chemical agent, have withered the once-lush fields and forests. Surviving in the now-called Plaguewood, can the martial traditions of the Buramogs keep protecting the Orcs against Human and Elvish aggression?"

  SMA_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Halfling Principality of Smallshore-Gladcross, placed on the coast between Arrador and Ceraun, enjoys a positive relationship with its powerful neighbors as an important exporter of goods. This balance is however increasingly fragile as the two powers desire to expand their market south of the Principality, in the resource-full Moorweald and Whiskerfields. Will Smallshore-Gladcross manage to protect its independence while many citizens call the monarchy to safeguard the oppressed Halfling minority in Ceraun?"
