  DUM_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Empire of Dumonia is a land of ancient traditions and fading glory, once the center of human power before the rise of magic brought it crashing down. The Nightfall led to the collapse of most of the empire, and today only the heartlands on Noricum remain under imperial control. Dumonia is a shadow of its former self and lags behind in the technological advancements that have swept other nations. \n\nBut the young emperor of the Romhaar family, eager to restore the empire's former glory, has sought to chart a new path for Dumonia. He has turned his sights towards the southeastern continent of Locari, a vast and untamed wilderness filled with new wonders and untold riches waiting to be claimed. \n\nWith his support, a new wave of Dumonian colonizers has set out to tame the wilds of Locari under the leadership of the South Seas Company, building new settlements and bringing with them the promise of progress and prosperity. But their presence has not gone unopposed, and the colonizers must constantly struggle against the fierce resistance of the indigenous peoples who call Locari home. \n\nMeanwhile, a new force has arisen in the empire: the fanatical Order of the Sun. This religious organization worships the god of the sun and has gained a powerful following among the Dumonian people. The Order's zealotry has fueled a renewed sense of pride and purpose in the empire, but also a dangerous streak of fanaticism and intolerance. \n\nAs the empire struggles to find its place in a changing world, tensions simmer and threats loom on all sides. But one thing is clear: the fate of Dumonia hangs in the balance, and only bold and visionary leadership will be able to guide it through the challenges ahead."

This land has incurred the punishment of the nightbane, and Jurian answers the call. With fanatic fervour, he has established a foothold for the inquisition to carry out retribution and return these green pastures to the righteous. This expedition will prove his faith and spread the truth of Kamiros to the ignorant. May the night horrors fear, for the sunkissed have arrived."
  YAN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Yanger Nomads are a people hailing from the Western reaches of Noricum on the vast steppes. Historically these lands lay as a former imperial province of Dumonia, the territory ripe for much agriculture, as well as serving as levy acquisition for bolstering the military of the empire, albeit conquered, Dumonia soon fell, and now these steppes lay in control of men-hardened by war. With much talk of magic and the return of the gods people look for an answer. In the eternal skies of the steppes exists a chaotic storm, serving as a prophecy for the many religious of forthcoming change. And the nation lies prepared to weather the storm."
  AUM_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Order of the Sun is a dominion within the Dumonian Empire. It is a small although powerful semi-independent theocratic state that serves as the centre of the faith for the Cult of the Sun. The state is said to be guided directly by Holy Kamiros, Lord of Light, with the high priest merely acting as their interpreter. The Bright Judge works to uphold this righteous land as a haven for all believers, by driving away darkness and spreading his divine nature through his holy word. This sacred land is a beacon for all who seek Kamiros and his teachings."
